In order to explore more the pygame library we need to built a basic game using the following specs: 

* The Player should be able to use the keyboard from left to right with screen limits. 
* The Player figure should be above 50 px from bottom to top. 
* You will need to create an Enemy Class, it will move from top to bottom direction in an infinitum way
* You will need to have a health or life value indicator, if the enemies pass below the player limits it will decrease the life.
* You will need to have a end of game sprite

My own goals with this is to create the basics movement(-x, x) for a clone of chromium game.
